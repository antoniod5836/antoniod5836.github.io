## About Me

I am a biostatistics Ph.D. student at New York University, my thesis advisors are [Michele Santacatterina](https://michelesantacatterina.github.io/) and [Samrachana Adhikari](https://samrachana.com/). My research focuses on the development and applications of causal inference and data science methods using both experimental and observational data. Past projects have included methods for improving precision when estimating heterogenous treatment effects and developing new doubly robust estimators for time-to-event outcomes in platform designs. 


## Research Interests

- **Causal inference** , **nonparametric statistical methods**, **semiparametric theory**, **data science** and **machine learning** with applications.  

## Employment

- **[Mar. 2025]** Data science intern - Baseball Solutions, inc. Baltimore, Maryland.
